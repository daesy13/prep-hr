// Write an "assertWithinRange" function from scratch.

// The idea here is similar to when someone says, "Give me a number between 1 and 5". 
// You usually think the possible answers are "1, 2, 3, 4, or 5".  
// I.e., you usually don't interpret the options as being "2, 3, or 4".  

// Notes:
// * Assume that the "actual" and "expected" arguments are always numbers 
// (e.g., not booleans or other types that don't make sense in the context of examining a "range".)

// Examples

// SUCCESS CASE IN ACTUAL USE

// var blackjackScore = 20;
// assertWithinRange(4, 21, blackjackScore, 'blackjack score should be between 4 and 21');
// // console output:
// // passed

// SUCCESS CASE IN ACTUAL USE

var dieRoll = 1;
// assertWithinRange(1, 6, dieRoll, 'die roll should be between 1 and 6');
// // console output:
// // passed

// FAILURE CASE IN ACTUAL USE

var price = 101;
// assertWithinRange(1, 100, price, 'price should be between 1 and 100');
// console output:
// FAIL [price should be between 1 and 100] "101" not within range 1 to 100

function assertWithinRange(low, high, actual, testName) {
  if (actual >= low && actual <= high){
  	console.log('passed');
  }
  else{
  	console.log('FAILED ' + testName + " answer is: " + actual + " it shuould between: " + low + " and " + high)
  }
}

// console.log(assertWithinRange(1, 6, dieRoll, 'die roll should be between 1 and 6'))
console.log(assertWithinRange(1, 100, price, 'price should be between 1 and 100'))
